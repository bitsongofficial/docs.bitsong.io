# How to Import Your BitSong Wallet

We are using as example Keplr but in the "[**Wallets**](../../btsg/wallets.md)" section you have other valid options as well.\
\
**1.** Make sure you have installed the **Keplr** browser extension. If you don't already have it, then you can download the extension and install it from [**here**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en)**.**

**2.** Once you have your Keplr extension installed, open it. In the new window that opens, select "_Import existing account_."

**3.** This is probably the most important step! Insert your BitSong mainnet Mnemonic Key. Then you can name your wallet, set a password, and proceed.&#x20;

**6.** Wallet.bitsong will then execute Keplr and will prompt you to **add and connect the bitsong-2b** chain. You must approve both actions by signing them with Keplr.
