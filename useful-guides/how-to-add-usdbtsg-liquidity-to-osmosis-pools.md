**6.** Now it's time to select the pool to which you want to add liquidity. **** You can find **three** different BTSG pools: Pool #**574** $ATOM/$BTSG - Pool #**573** $BTSG/$OSMO and Pool #**592** $UST/$BTSG. ****&#x20;

**In this guide, we will add liquidity to Pool #573 $BTSG/$OSMO but the principles are the same for all Osmosis BTSG pools.**&#x20;
