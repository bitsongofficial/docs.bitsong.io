# DAO DAO

## DAO DAO: [https://daodao.zone/bitsong](https://daodao.zone/bitsong)

### Introduction

DAODAO introduced native support for Bitsong during Q2 2024, following [governance approval ](https://www.mintscan.io/bitsong/proposals/36)of funding the deployment & support!&#x20;

### How DAOs Work

DAO's can be created by defining its initial configurations, and then instantiating the set of smart contracts deployed on Bitsong. This can be done through the [DAO DAO UI](https://daodao.zone/dao/create?chain=bitsong-2b), or even through other custom methods of calling Bitsong. These set of contracts source code is [open source and verifiable](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/releases), bringing certainty that DAOs on Bitsong perform as the official source code public.

Because DAO DAO DAOs operate by smart contracts on a blockchain, they are transparent by default. This means that votes, the voting power of members, and actions a DAO takes are all publicly auditable. This can help provide trust that DAO members are being good stewards of their communities.

With a DAO created, participants can choose how to collaborate, iterate and curate their DAO and on-chain actions. Each DAO has a treasury and is essentially a shared wallet between its members, where actions performed by this wallet requires a level of agreement between its users.

### Types of DAOs

#### [Membership Based](https://docs.daodao.zone/introduction/whats-a-dao#members-multisig-replacement)

Each account has a membership and voting power.

#### [Fungible Token Based](https://docs.daodao.zone/introduction/whats-a-dao#tokens)

Each account has a membership and voting power based on stake of a specific token. [This include Bitsongs Fantoken modules.](../features-and-modules/fan-tokens.md)

#### [Non-Fungible Token Based](https://docs.daodao.zone/introduction/whats-a-dao#nfts)

Each account has a membership and voting power based on stake of a specific NFT collection.

### Advanced Voting Configurations

DAOs are completely programmable, meaning that members can customize and even extend its DAOs configuration, allowing for the DAO to form to what the DAO members need.

#### [SubDAOs & SubDAO Admins](https://docs.daodao.zone/dao-management/subdaos/what)

SubDAOs are DAOs with other DAOs set with admin level permissions.

#### [Vetoable DAO](https://docs.daodao.zone/dao-governance/manage-vetoable-daos)

Vetoable DAOs can have proposals veto'd by an external source. &#x20;

### [IBC & DAO's](https://docs.daodao.zone/dao-management/dao-treasury/how-to-manage-cross-chain-tokens)

DAOs can have accounts on any chain, thanks to [Polytone](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/polytone).
